# Data-Structure--Start-15-july-2024
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in Java. It includes arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, and hash tables. Each data structure is provided with detailed explanations, code examples, and test cases to aid in understanding and practical application.
Features
Array: Static and dynamic arrays with basic operations.
Linked List: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
Stack: Array-based and linked list-based implementations.
Queue: Array-based, linked list-based, and circular queues.
Tree: Binary tree, binary search tree, and AVL tree.
Heap: Min-heap and max-heap.
Graph: Adjacency matrix and list representations, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford.
Hash Table: Separate chaining and open addressing techniques.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to optimize, add new data structures, or fix bugs. Ensure code is well-documented and tested before submitting a pull request.
